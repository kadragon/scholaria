# Progress

## Summary
Reorganizing `docs/agents/TASKS.md` to be concise and reflect actionable backlog items.

## Goal & Approach
Follow plan to design compact section outline, edit the file, add new backlog entries, and proofread.

## Completed Steps

- Step 2: Rewrote `docs/agents/TASKS.md` using the compact section layout with updated copy.
- Step 3: Embedded new backlog items for README alignment and admin datetime serialization.
