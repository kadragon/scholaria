# Progress: FastAPI Context DB Sync

**Summary**
- Task kicked off with research highlighting mismatched DB connections causing failing FastAPI context tests.

**Goal & Approach**
- Align SQLAlchemy configuration with Django test DB via TDD (new config-level test) and ensure context endpoints read Django data.

**Completed Steps**
- Added regression test (`api/tests/test_config.py`) for sqlite database URL mapping.
- Implemented database config helper & sqlite-aware engine setup (`api/config.py`, `api/models/base.py`).
- Aligned Django test DB to shared sqlite file (`core/test_settings.py`, `pyproject.toml`) and introduced lazy engine binding.

**Current Failures**
- None; targeted tests now green.

**Decision Log**
- Will add regression test for sqlite URL mapping before implementation.

**Next Step**
- Task complete; no further actions.
