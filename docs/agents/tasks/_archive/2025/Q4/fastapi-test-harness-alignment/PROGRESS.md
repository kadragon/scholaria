# Progress: FastAPI Test Harness Alignment

## Summary
- Centralized database overrides and updated admin/CORS tests so the FastAPI pytest suite passes entirely under the shared SQLite harness.

## Goal & Approach
- Analyze and refactor test database setup so it mirrors the FastAPI/PostgreSQL stack without relying on Django artifacts.

- Audited `backend/tests/conftest.py` and noticed per-worker SQLite engines created via `Base.metadata.create_all` without Alembic migrations.
- Removed custom dependency override/engine teardown in `backend/tests/test_contexts_write.py`, reusing shared fixtures and patching ingestion side-effects.

## Current Failures
- _None_: `uv run pytest backend/tests -q` now passes (82 passed, 2 skipped).

## Decision Log
- Centralized FastAPI dependency overrides (conftest) resolves missing-table issue; SQLite bootstrap is sufficient for test coverage.
- Admin bulk embedding test now seeds context items and mocks embedding generation to reflect synchronous pipeline.
- CORS env-var integration test reloads `backend.config`/`backend.main` and reapplies DB overrides to respect FASTAPI_ALLOWED_ORIGINS.

## Next Step
- Task complete; proceed with archiving per retention policy.
