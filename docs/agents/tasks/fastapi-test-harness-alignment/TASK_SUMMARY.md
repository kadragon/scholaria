# Task Summary: FastAPI Test Harness Alignment
- Goal: Restore a fully green FastAPI pytest suite without Django-era fixtures.
- Centralized DB overrides via `backend/tests/conftest.py` and removed module-level SQLite engines.
- Reworked `test_contexts_write.py` to reuse shared fixtures and patched Docling/OpenAI interactions.
- Seeded context items and mocked embedding regeneration in admin bulk tests for deterministic counts.
- Reloaded FastAPI config/main modules in CORS tests to honor `FASTAPI_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` env overrides.
- Updated testing and environment docs to reference the FastAPI pytest workflow (`uv run pytest backend/tests -q`).
- Tests: `uv run pytest backend/tests -q` â†’ 82 passed, 2 skipped (warnings only).
- Result: FastAPI test harness aligns with production stack without Django dependencies.
