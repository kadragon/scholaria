# Progress: Topic Slug Feature

## Summary
Adding URL-friendly slug to Topic model for shareable links.

## Goal & Approach
- TDD approach: test → implement → refactor
- Auto-generate slug from topic name with uniqueness enforcement
- Maintain backward compatibility with numeric ID routes

## Completed Steps
1. ✅ Research phase — analyzed codebase, identified affected files
2. ✅ Plan phase — outlined steps, test cases, rollback strategy
3. ✅ Created task artifacts

## Current Failures
- None (not started implementation)

## Decision Log
- **Slug generation strategy:** Auto-generate from name, append `-N` on collision
- **Romanization:** Use simple Latin transliteration for Korean
- **Backward compat:** Keep ID-based routes, add new slug-based route

## Next Step
Step 2: Write test for slug generation utility
