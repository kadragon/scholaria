134 tests passing | All core functionality implemented | Ready for deployment

---

## ðŸ“‹ Remaining Tasks

### Development Documentation

- [x] Contributing guidelines âœ… COMPLETED
- [ ] Testing strategy documentation
- [ ] Architecture decision records

### Production Setup

- [ ] Production Docker Compose configuration
- [ ] Environment variable management
- [ ] Database backup strategy
- [ ] Log aggregation and monitoring
- [ ] Health check endpoints

### CI/CD Pipeline

- [ ] Set up automated testing pipeline
- [ ] Set up code quality checks (linting, type checking)
- [ ] Set up automated deployment
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting

### Real-World Validation

- [ ] > 80% of test queries return relevant citations
- [ ] Answer latency < 3 seconds performance benchmarks

### Architecture Improvements (Priority)

- [x] **Refactor Context-Topic Relationship**: Change from 1:N to N:N relationship between Topics and Contexts âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] **Improve Context Model Structure**: âœ… COMPLETED
  - 1 Context = 1 PDF document OR 1 Markdown file OR Multiple FAQ items âœ…
  - Hide individual chunks from admin interface - show only Context-level view âœ…
  - Context detail view should show chunk statistics (e.g., "25 chunks, 15,487 characters") âœ…
- [ ] **Enhanced Admin Interface**:
  - Context creation workflow: select type â†’ upload file â†’ automatic chunking (hidden from user)
  - Context detail page: show full content, chunk count, processing status
  - Topic management: multi-select contexts to associate with topics
- [x] **Database Schema Updates**: âœ… COMPLETED
  - Add Context.original_content field to store full document text âœ… COMPLETED
  - Add Context.chunk_count and Context.processing_status fields âœ… COMPLETED
  - Update Context-Topic relationship to ManyToMany âœ… COMPLETED
  - Create migration scripts for existing data âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] **Update Admin Views**: âœ… COMPLETED
  - Remove ContextItem from main admin navigation âœ… COMPLETED
  - Create custom Context admin with file upload and chunk preview âœ… COMPLETED
  - Add inline Context selector to Topic admin âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] **API Endpoint Updates**: âœ… COMPLETED
  - Update context endpoints to return full content + metadata âœ… COMPLETED
  - Add chunk-level endpoints for internal use only âœ… COMPLETED
  - Update topic endpoints to handle multiple contexts âœ… COMPLETED

### Library Migration: Unstructured â†’ Docling

- [ ] **Research & Analysis** (descoped â€“ decision: focus on Docling implementation only)
  - [ ] Compare Docling vs Unstructured capabilities for PDF parsing (not required)
  - [ ] Analyze performance and quality differences (not required)
  - [ ] Identify any feature gaps or migration risks (not required)
- [x] **Update Dependencies**:
  - [x] Remove `unstructured` from `pyproject.toml`
  - [x] Add `docling` dependency (lockfile regenerated)
  - [x] Update Docker configuration to drop Unstructured API service
- [x] **Refactor PDF Parser** (`rag/ingestion/parsers.py:6`):
  - [x] Replace `from unstructured.partition.pdf import partition_pdf` with Docling imports
  - [x] Update `PDFParser.parse_file()` method to use Docling's `DocumentConverter`
  - [x] Maintain same interface for backward compatibility
- [x] **Update Tests**:
  - [x] Update `rag/tests/test_ingestion.py` to work with new Docling implementation
  - [x] Update `rag/tests/test_performance_benchmarks.py` if needed (reviewed: no changes required)
  - [x] Update `rag/tests/test_docker_integration.py` for new dependencies
- [ ] **Validate Migration**:
  - [x] Run existing tests to ensure functionality is preserved (`python manage.py test rag.tests.test_ingestion`)
  - [ ] Test PDF parsing quality with sample documents
  - [ ] Performance benchmark comparison before/after migration
  - [ ] Verify Docker integration still works
- [x] **Clean Up**:
  - [x] Remove any unused unstructured-related code
  - [x] Update documentation (deployment guide, AGENTS)
  - [x] Run linting and type checking (`ruff`, `mypy`)
