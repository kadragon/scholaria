# Script Quality Constraints

## Portability
- Preserve POSIX shell compatibility; scripts must run on macOS and Linux without modifications.

## Logging
- Retain established emoji/text prefixes (e.g., `üê≥`, `[INFO]`) to keep execution flow readable.

## Dependency Handling
- Abort early when Docker or `uv` is unavailable and print remediation instructions.
- Align health checks with the current service topology (backend, postgres, redis, qdrant, frontend, celery-worker, flower).
