# Documentation Maintenance Flow

## Status Sync
- Keep the `README.md` "Project Status" section as the authoritative high-level summary; other docs may reference but must not drift.

## Review Checklist
- Confirm runnable commands before publishing.
- Validate links after any file rename.
- Capture acceptance criteria changes in `.spec/` before editing guides.
