# Documentation Mission

## Intent
- Maintain Scholaria operational knowledge through a single Markdown-driven source of truth.
- Ensure administrators and end users can execute workflows without external support.

## Canonical Sources
- `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`: branching, TDD, quality gates.
- `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`: production compose usage, nginx proxy, required env vars.
- `docs/ADMIN_GUIDE.md` and `docs/USER_GUIDE.md`: role-specific flows.
- `docs/TESTING_STRATEGY.md`: pytest coverage, parallel expectations.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md`: rationale for key platform choices.
- `docs/BACKUP_STRATEGY.md`: backup and recovery checklist.
