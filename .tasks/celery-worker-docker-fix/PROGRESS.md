# Progress: Celery Worker Docker Fix

## 2025-10-11
- Initialized Research, Spec Delta, and Plan documents for the task.
- Added `scripts/docker/celery-entrypoint.sh` to provision an isolated uv-based environment under `/tmp/uv/backend-worker`, including bootstrap logic for Python 3.13.
- Updated `docker-compose.yml` to consume the new entrypoint, expose `UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT`, and set explicit Redis host/port/db variables.
- Verified the worker stack:
  - `docker compose up -d --no-build celery-worker`
  - `docker compose logs celery-worker --tail=40` (confirmed `celery@... ready`)
  - `docker compose run --rm --no-deps celery-worker -- celery -A celery_app inspect ping`
- Observed initial image rebuild failure due to `torch` lacking CPython 3.14 wheels; mitigation left for follow-up (image build still requires Python 3.13 base or uv-managed interpreter).

## 2025-10-12
- Added `torch>=2.0.0` to `backend/pyproject.toml` dependencies to ensure torch is explicitly included.
- Regenerated `backend/uv.lock` with `uv lock`.
- Successfully built `celery-worker` image with torch 2.8.0 installed (cp313 wheels).
- Started `celery-worker` container; confirmed uv environment bootstrapping and package installation.
- Worker attempts to connect to Redis (expected, as Redis is not started in isolated test).
- Celery worker Docker fix completed; ready for E2E testing with full stack.
